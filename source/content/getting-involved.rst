Getting Involved
================

There are many ways to get involved and contribute to the SmartGridready project.
This chapter outlines the steps to participate based on your interests and expertise.

Planners and Architects
-----------------------

If you are an architect/planner of homes and buildings or a developer of real estate and residential areas you can
include SmartGridready compliant :term:`Products` and :term:`Communicator` devices into your planning. This will ensure
a seamless integration of all your energy consumers, producers and energy management devices to achieve an overall energy
management without any gaps.

You can then label your building(s) with the SmartGridready label. See :ref:`sgr-certification` for details.

Refer to the `SmartGridready Library <https:library.smartgridready.com>`_ to get a list of SmartGridready :term:`Products`
and :term:`Communicator` devices.


:term:`Product` suppliers
-------------------------

As a supplier of :term:`Products` that are subject to energy management such as :term:`Smart Meter`, :term:`PVA`,
heat-pumps, :term:`EVSE` or :term:`EMS`, you can apply for a SmartGridready declaration label for your :term:`Product`.

See :ref:`sgr-certification` for detailed instructions.


:term:`Communicator` suppliers
------------------------------

As a supplier of :term:`Communicator` devices that are subject to energy management such as :term:`EMS` or
:term:`Flexibility Manager` systems you can:

* Integrate the :term:`CommHandler` library into your device software to communicate with SmartGridready :term:`Products`
  using a generic API. See :ref:`commhandler-libraries` for details.

* Make use of the :term:`Intermediary` to communicate with SmartGridready :term:`Products` through a generic REST-API.
  See :ref:`intermediary` for details.

* Apply for SmartGridready declaration label for your :term:`Communicator` device. See :ref:`sgr-certification` for details.
