Functional Profiles
===================

A :term:`Functional Profile` describes a set of related functionalities provided by a :term:`Product`.
It thereby focuses entirely on the functionality. Any transport-specific details are not part of the functional profile
(e.g. on how to get or set a :term:`Data Point` on a specific product).

The main intent is to allow communicator manufacturers to easily implement their use cases based on logically grouped
:term:`Data Points`, while device-specific communication details are handled SmartGridread Communication Handler library.

Any :term:`Product` that supports the :term:`Functional Profiles` required for a specific use case is therefore automatically
compatible and can be used without changing the :term:`Communicator` implementation.

The :term:`Functional Profiles` build the foundation of the SmartGridready specification and allow access to any
SmartGridready compliant :term:`Product` through a generic API.

The SmartGridready library lists the currently available :term:`Functional Profiles`:
See `Functional Profile Library <https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate>`_

This list of :term:`Functional Profile` definitions is subject to change and will grow in the future, as new
:term:`Functional Profiles` will be added.

As a :term:`Product` supplier you need check which :term:`Functional Profiles` suit your :term:`Product`'s functionalities
and add the matching :term:`Functional Profiles` to the :term:`External Interface Definition` file.

:term:`Functional Profile` Structure
------------------------------------

:numref:`figure_functional_profile_structure` shows the basic structure of a :term:`Functional Profile`

.. _figure_functional_profile_structure:

   :alt: :term:`Functional Profile` Structure

   Functional Profile Structure

A :term:`Functional Profile` is part of a :term:`Product` description and includes the:

* Definition of the :term:`Functional Profile` with identification and description.
* :term:`Data Points` defining access points to measure and control data on the :term:`Product`.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   PRODUCT
   ├── DEFINITION (Generic product info ...)
   │
   ├── FUNCTIONAL-PROFILE (ActiveEnergyAC)
   │   ├── DATAPOINT (ActiveEnergyACTot)
   │   ├── DATAPOINT (ActiveEnergyACTot)
   │   ├── DATAPOINT (ActiveEnergyACL1)
   │   ├── DATAPOINT (ActiveEnergyACL3)
   │   └── DATAPOINT (ActiveEnergyACL3)
   │
   └──FUNCTIONAL-PROFILE (ActivePowerAC)
       ├── DATAPOINT (ActivePowerACTot)
       ├── DATAPOINT (ActivePowerACL1)
       ├── DATAPOINT (ActivePowerACL3)
       └── DATAPOINT (ActivePowerACL3)

The illustration above shows a sample for the structure of a :term:`Product` description file in XML (:term:`EID`).
The :term:`Product` description exposes its functionalities by including two :term:`Functional Profiles`.
The example shows a simple :term:`Smart Meter` that exposes AC-energy metering and AC-power measurement functionalities.

A :term:`Communicator` software can read from or write to the device by addressing the :term:`Data Point` by
:term:`Functional Profile` name and :term:`Data Point` name. Java code example:

.. code-block:: java

    var acPowerTotal = meteringDevice.getVal("ActiveEnergyAC", "ActiveEnergyACTot");

A functional profile is defined/identified by:

* **Functional Profile Category:** see :ref:`functional_profile_category`
* **Functional Profile Type:** see: :ref:`functional_profile_type`
* **Level Of Operation:** see :ref:`level_of_operation`

.. _generic_attributes:

Generic Attributes
------------------

Generic attributes incorporate hierarchical inheritance as follows:

- Generic attributes always apply to the data point
- Generic attributes defined on functional profile level apply to all data points of the same
  functional profile.
- Generic attributes defined on device level apply to all functional profiles, and thus to all
  data points of the device If the same attribute is defined on multiple levels the most specific
  definition supersedes any other definition (i.e. data point over functional profile over).

.. _static_datapoint_attributes:

Static Data Point Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These values describe the measurement limits for data points. Depending
on the definition level they apply either to a specific data point,
every data point of a functional profile, or the the entire device.

These attributes are generally used to search for devices that fulfill a
set of minimum requirements to support a specific use case.

.. _stability_fallback:

Stability Fallback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A consumer or a generating system receives the permit for a load change
for a certain period of time. This time is always set to 0 each time a
confirmation message is received (HeartBeat).

The figure below depicts the typical flow 1. the device starts at
initial value. 2. regular communication starts. The communicator
periodically sets new set values. 3. communication breaks. The device
receives its last set value. 4. after reaching the timeout the device
automatically sets the fallback value.

      - Value the device uses in case of a fallback.
      - 6.0 A


.. _smooth_transition:

Smooth Transition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time behavior of a transition from a power adjustment (positive as
well as negative) can be determined by several time values, so that this
starts with a random time delay, changes via a ramp and an expiry time
with return to the initial value. To avoid return to the initial value
the device must either specify the revert time to zero (i.e. no return),
or the communicator must repeat the target value before the revert time
window expires.

The figure below depicts the typical flow 1. the command for the new
target value is received 2. the device randomly starts the ramp, but
latest after winTms 3. the ramp reaches the new target value after
rmpTms 4. if no new target value is received, the device starts
returning to the old target value after rvtTms 5. the ramp reaches the
old target value after rmpTms

      - unsigned long
      - Determines how long the operating mode should be active. When the time has elapsed, the operating
        mode is automatically terminated. If rvrtTms = 0 (standard value), the operating mode remains active
        until a new command is received.
      - 600 s


.. _datapoint_quality:

Data Point Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SGr has attributes to denote the quality of the measured value. The
presence of any quality attributes either on functional profile or data
point level indicate that the com handler will provide these dynamic
attributes at run time (see documentation of SGr com handler libs)

:term:`Data Points`
-------------------
A :term:`Functional Profile` mainly defines a set of :term:`Data Points`. The :term:`Data Points` define access points to values
that can be read from or written to the product.

The :term:`Data Points` are defined by the following attributes:

If a :term:`Data Point` is defined as mandatory in the functional profile, it must also be present in the product implementing
this functional profile.

If no :term:`Data Point` is mandatory in the functional profile, then at least one :term:`Data Point` must be recommended and at least
one of the recommended :term:`Data Points` must be presentin the product implementing this :term:`Functional Profile`.


Sub Data Points
---------------

Data Points that are connected to other :term:`Data Points` can be modeled as sub :term:`Data Points`.
The connection between :term:`Data Point` and sub :term:`Data Point` are defined with naming conventions. If e.g. a :term:`Data Point` has the
name "MainDatapoint" and is connected with a sub :term:`Data Point` "SubDatapoint" the sub :term:`Data Point` name has the name
"MainDatapoint.SubDatapoint" - this means, the sub :term:`Data Point` name is appended to the main :term:`Data Point` name separated
with a dot.

An example for a sub :term:`Data Point` is "Voltage.Precision" as the precision of the :term:`Data Point` "Voltage".


SmartGridready :term:`Functional Profile` Library
-------------------------------------------------

The currently published :term:`Functional Profiles` are available on the
`SmartGridready Functional Profile Library <https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate>`_.

You can add a serach filter by modifying the base URL and adding query parameters.
Use the following base URL:

.. code-block:: text

    https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate

and add http query parameters like:

.. code-block:: text

    https://library.smartgridready.ch/FunctionalProfileTemplate?level=2m,4m&category=SGCP

Each parameter can contain a comma separated list of filter values:

.. code-block::

    ...&level=2m,4m&...

Available parameters are:

* release (aliases: state, releaseState)
* level (aliases: levelOfOperation)
* category (aliases: functionalProfileCategory)
* type (aliases: functionalProfileType)



Defining :term:`Functional Profiles`
------------------------------------

File Naming Scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Functional Profiles` should have the following file naming convention:

.. code-block:: none

    FP_[specificationOwnerIdentification]_[FunctionalProfileCategory]_[FunctionalProfileType]_[levelOfOperation]_[majorVerion].[minorVerion].xml

**Writing Descriptions**
Functional profile descriptions should be structured as follows:
* Image indicating the typical use of the functional profile, together with an easily understandable title
* Short explanation (i.e. long version of the title)
* Detailed explanation, including very attribute.
* Description on how to apply the functional profile concerning presence level (i.e. how to handle recommended and optional :term:`Data Points`)



:term:`Functional Profile` Release Process
------------------------------------------

Scope
^^^^^

This document structures the process for the life-cycle of functional
profiles.

States
^^^^^^

A :term:`Functional Profile` cycles through the following states:

      - The :term:`Functional Profile` has been developed and is ready for review by its relevant stakeholders.
      - Review
    * - Publish
      - The :term:`Functional Profile` has passed the review and is ready to be used.
      - Published
    * - Revoke
      - A :term:`Functional Profile` has passed its usefulness and is not needed any more. Any state can be directly revoked.
      - Revoked


Creating new :term:`Functional Profiles`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the :term:`Functional Profile` interest groups sees requirements for a new or
improved functionality, it will create a new :term:`Functional Profile` XML with
state “draft”. A new issue will be created for this :term:`Functional Profile`.
The issue has

- a self-evident description covering

  - context in which the need for this :term:`Functional Profile` has arisen
  - purpose of this :term:`Functional Profile`

- a label of the :term:`Functional Profile` interest group concerned
- the project “:term:`Functional Profile` Interest Group” assigned, with status
  “draft”

Any documentation, discussion, and work on the elaboration of this
:term:`Functional Profile` will be tracked in this github issue.

The team then works directly on the XML.

Ready for review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a new :term:`Functional Profile` is considered ready it switches the state
to review. The following criteria must be met for this step

1. Purpose and functionality of the :term:`Functional Profile` is defined
2. level of operation is defined
3. Data points are defined, including mandatory/recommended/optional,
   units, type and read/write
4. Generic attributes for the :term:`Functional Profile` and/or its data points
   are defined

Publish
^^^^^^^

To publish a :term:`Functional Profile` the following criteria must be met:

1. The version is set correctly according to the versioning scheme (see
   below).
2. All stakeholders concerned are happy with the content of the
   :term:`Functional Profile`, and have given their formal consent.
3. “SGr Deklarationsstelle” has been informed about the upcoming
   publication.
4. The :term:`Functional Profile` has been tested by at least one product.

Published :term:`Functional Profiles` will not change anymore. If a change is
requested, a new :term:`Functional Profile` with increased version number will
be created (see versioning scheme below). Therefore, only the release
note structure of the :term:`Functional Profile` can be updated on publishing.

Revoke
^^^^^^

If a :term:`Functional Profile` shall not be used anymore it can be revoked.
Only the note structure of the :term:`Functional Profile` can be updated on
publishing.

Revoked :term:`Functional Profiles` are obsolete and shall not be used for
further declarations of products and communicators. However, they will
remain the data base for legacy reasons.

.. _version_number:

Versioning Scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Functional Profiles` are numbered as follows: ``Major.Minor.Build``

+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Number                   | Description                               |
+==========================+===========================================+
| ``Major``                | Describes the major functionality family. |
|                          | Breaking changes implies an increment of  |
|                          | the major number                          |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``Minor``                | Describes a backward compatible           |
|                          | evolution. Only new functionality is      |
|                          | added, but remaining functionality is     |
|                          | never changed                             |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ``Build``                | The functionality remains identical, but  |
|                          | minor non-functional details change, such |
|                          | as descriptions, translations, remarks    |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

Release Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The release notes section contains meta data that describe history and current state of the functional profile.

.. list-table:: Releas Notes
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 30 70

    * - Element
      - Description
    * - Status
      - One of 'Draft', 'Review', 'Released', 'Revoked'
    * - Remarks
      - Optional, text with remarks e.g. can be useful during the draft phase for todo's etc.
    * - Change Log
      - Optional, can occur multiple times. Contains release notes to the version concerned



..  TODO's
..  Comments regarding functional profile category and profile types:
    - FP-Category seems to be oriented on the type of the product HeatPump, EVSE, SGCP, Smart Meter etc.
      However: Metering category is more related to many types of products that allow of metering (Zähler) and measuring (messen).

    - FP-type seems to be oriented on concrete functionalities like measure ActivePowerAC, HeatCoolCtrl, LoadCtrl
      There are functional profile types that are used within multiple categories:
      type EnergyMonitor -> categories battery, battery system and heatpump-control

    - LoadReduction_EVSE vs. EMS_Current_Limit: would level of operation be sufficient to distinguish them?

    - BiDirFlexMgmt vs. FlexMgmt: The FP template description for BiDirFlex says nothing about BiDir, however the
      description of FlexMgmt does.
