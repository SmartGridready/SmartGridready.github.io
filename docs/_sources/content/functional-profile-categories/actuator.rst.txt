Actuator
--------

Actuators are devices that convert control signals into physical action. They can be:

* Discrete (on/off), such as electrical relays or solenoids, used for simple switching tasks.
* Continuous, such as servo motors or stepper motors, which can precisely control positions like the angle of a
  lever or valve.

Currently SmartGridready defines a :term:`Functional Profile` for a single relay contact with
:ref:`functional_profile_category` **Actuator** and :ref:`functional_profile_type` **Relais**. The contact is represented
by a writable and readable boolean value.
