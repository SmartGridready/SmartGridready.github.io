.. _planner_architects:

Planners and Architects
-----------------------

If you are an architect/planner of homes and buildings or a developer of real estate and residential areas you can
include SmartGridready compliant :term:`Products` and :term:`Communicator` devices into your planning. This will ensure
a seamless integration of all your energy consumers, producers and energy management devices to achieve an overall energy
management without any gaps.

You can then label your building(s) with the SmartGridready label. See :ref:`sgr-declaration` for details.

Refer to the `SmartGridready Library <https:library.smartgridready.com>`_ to get a list of SmartGridready :term:`Products`
and :term:`Communicator` devices.

.. _product_suppliers:

As a supplier of :term:`Products` that are subject to energy management such as :term:`Smart Meter`, :term:`PVA`,

See :ref:`sgr-declaration` for detailed instructions.
