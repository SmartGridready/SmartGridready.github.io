    Communicator
        The Communicator is a device designed to interface with :term:`Product` devices. In SmartGridready the Communicator
        leverages a generic API to seamlessly communicate with :term:`Product` devices. A common example for a
        Communicator is an energy manager device.

    CommHandler
        The CommHandler is a software component that reads XML-based interface descriptions, which define conversion
        rules between the generic API used by the :term:`Communicator` and :term:`Product`-specific APIs.
        This allows it to adapt to different Products without requiring manual configuration/daption.

    Datapoint
        A data point is a read- and/or writeable property of a :term:`Product`. In SmartGridready a :term:`Datapoint`
        is a child element of a :term:`Functional Profile`. An example for a readable data point is "ActivePowerACL1"
        of the :term:`Functional Profile` "ActivePowerAC" and is used to measure the AC power consumtion on phase 1.

    Datapoints
        Plural form of :term:`Datapoint`

    Device Driver Adapter
        Device Driver Adpaters within SmartGridready adapt the API given by the :term:`CommHandler` libraries to
        a transport layer/technology. SmratGridready provides default adapters for Modbus, Web-Services and MQTT
        as libraries in Python and Java.

    EID
        External Interface Description in XML (also known as EI-XML). The EID defines the conversion rules needed to
        adapt a specific :term:`Product` to the SmartGridready generic API. It contains a list of :term:`Functional
        Profile`'s that the :term:`Product` supports, together with the conversion rules to adapt the :term:`Product`
        to the generic API interface.

    External Interface Definition
        See :term:`EID`

    EMS
        Energy Management System. Device or application used for power management within an power-grid or building. Within
        SmartGridready the :term:`EMS` acts usually as a :term:`Communicator`.

    EVSE
        Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment. Provides safe and managed electrical power to charge electric vehicles.

    Energy Manager
        See :term:`EMS`

    Flexibility Manager
        The Flexibility Manager acts within a power grid allowing an intelligent load management.

    Functional Profile
        The Functional Profile describes a set of common functionalities that are exposed trough the generic
        SmartGridready interface used by the :term:`Communicator`. A SmartGridready compliant :term:`Product` supports one or
        more Functional Profiles. Examples for Functional Profiles are: 'EnergyMonitor` for electric energy measurement,
        'HeatCoolControl' for heat pumps or 'EVSE Load Reduction' for electrical vehicle charging stations.

    Functional Profiles
        Plural form of :term:`Functional Profile`

    Functional Profile Type
        The type of a :term:`Functional Profile` defines a specific combination of related :term:`Datapoints`.
        See :ref:`functional_profile_types`.

    Functional Profile Types
        Plural form of :term:`Functional Profile Type`.

    Functional Profile Category
        A :term:`Functional Profile Category` defines the type or usage of the :term:`Product`. Examples are 'Metering'
        (for term:`Smart Meter`) or 'HeatPumpControl`. See :ref:`functional_profile_category`

    Functional Profile Categories
        Plural form of :term:`Functional Profile Category`

    Intermediary
        The :term:`Intermediary` is a microservice that exposes a REST API that allows seamless communication with
        SmartGridready compliant :term:`Product`. It can be deployed as a Docker container and is the ideal
        SmartGridready solution where no :term:`CommHandler` library is available.

    Level Of Operation
        :term:`Level Of Operation` is an attribute of a :term:`Functional Profile` that defines the complexity of
        the a :term:`Functional Profile` operation. See :ref:`level_of_operation`

    PVA
        A system of interconnected solar panels that generate electricity from sunlight.

    PV-Inverter
        Converts the DC electricity generated by PV solar panels into AC electricity, which is used by household
        appliances and the electrical grid.

    Product
        A Product is a device that provides power management related services and exposes its functionalities through a
        proprietary interface. The SmartGridready :term:`CommHandler` allows the :term:`Communicator` to communicate with
        the :term:`Product` through a generic interface, independent of the Product's proprietary implementation. Examples for
        :term:`Products` are smart meters, heat pumps, :term:`PVA`, :term:`EVSE`.

    Products
        Plural form of :term:`Product`

    SGCP
        Smart Grid Connection Point. A exposing an :term:`SGCP` allows load management by a power grid operator.

    Smart Meter
        A smart meter is an advanced electric energy meter that automatically records energy consumption and
        communicates the data to the utility provider in real-time or at scheduled intervals.
        Unlike traditional meters, smart meters enable remote readings, dynamic pricing, and better energy management,
        helping both consumers and providers optimize energy use.

    VNB
        'Verteilnetz Betreiber' stands for a power grid operator.
